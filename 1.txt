“The simplest way to understand how AI and ML relate to each other is: AI is the
broader concept of enabling a machine or system to sense, reason, act, or adapt like a
human. ML is an application of AI that allows machines to extract knowledge from
data and learn from it autonomously.
Artificial Learning is the capability of a computer system to mimic human cognitive
functions such as learning and problem-solving. Through AI, a computer system uses
math and logic to simulate the reasoning that people use to learn from new information
and make decisions
Cyber security is primarily about people, processes, and technologies working
together to encompass the full range of threat reduction, vulnerability reduction,
deterrence, international engagement, incident response, resiliency, and recovery
policies and activities, including computer network operations, information assurance,
law enforcement, etc.”
